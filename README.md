# Simple transparent Firefox theme
## About
A simple css theme that adds transparency to Firefox. Adds transparency to tabs, nav bar, url bar and the main window background.

Works with Hyprland when running Firefox on Wayland with Firefox' default dark theme. Other platforms / window managers / themes might need additional settings. Looks best with window managers / compositors that add blur to the background of windows.
